In this new beta release, we add support for static power models and also 70nm, 50nm and 35nm technologies.  Data for 70nm, 50nm and 35nm technologies are taken from the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors 2003 edition.  Since these are predicted data, so power estimates for those technologies are also predictions.

Currently these three technologies are not coded in the same fashion as the other technologies (above and including 0.1um).  For now, to use on of these three technologies, you need to declare 0.1um in the Makefile (define PARM_TECH_POINT=10 in DEFS line), and define the real technology in SIM_power_test.h (define TEST_LENGTH=70, 50 and 35 respectively, TEST_LENGTH=100 is for all other technologies).  So each time you change a technology, you need to make the library again.  This is a hack and we seek to change this in the next release.

Static power models incorporated into this release are taken from Xuning's work (Xuning Chen and Li-Shiuan Peh, "Leakage Power Modeling and Optimization in Interconnection Networks", in ISLPED, 2003).  Currently we only include P/N junction sub-threshold leakage, but this is the dominant part of static power.

Leakage power is reported in a different manner with dynamic power.  It is not reported in the "_report" function since it is not sensitive to switching activities (in reality it is, but we do not want to and also cannot guess the relative position of multiple inputs to a gate, so we use average of all input combinations as the leakage current of that gate).  Instead, an "I_static" is added to router, crossbar and buffer data structures, which is the average leakage current of that object.  So if you will use Orion's models in your own simulator and want to get the leakage power of a particular object, you need to multiple this field by the elapsed time.

If you use test_router utility to get router power estimates, note that leakage power (energy) is not included in the total energy report of crossbars and buffers, it is separately reported.  The total leakage power (energy) is both separately reported and included in the total router energy report.
