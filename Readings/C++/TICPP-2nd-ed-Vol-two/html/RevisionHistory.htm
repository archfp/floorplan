<h2>Revision history:</h2>

<h4>Revision 4, August 19, 2001</h4> 

<ul>

<LI><p>Restructured the book; this is the first version with 
<a href="http://www.freshsources.com">Chuck Allison</a> 
coauthoring. Incorporated Chuck's testing framework, which will be used 
throughout the book and automatically included as part of the book's build 
process in the makefiles.</p>

<LI><p>In the <b>code</b> subdirectory of the unpacked distribution, you can now 
use <b>make</b> to compile for Borland, Microsoft, Gnu g++2.95 (distributed with 
Cygwin) and Gnu g++3.0 (tested under Linux).</p>

<LI><p>Under Windows98/NT/2000, you will get best results running under the free 
Cygwin environment (www.Cygwin.com), even if you're compiling for Borland or 
Microsoft. In particular, some linker command lines for Microsoft are too long 
for Win98 COMMAND.COM, but work just fine under Cygwin.</p>

<LI><p>Made many code changes to allow programs to be run inside the test 
framework, in particular removing the need for user input when executing 
programs.</p>

<LI><p>Added //{L} ../TestSuite/Test in all the programs that <i>can</i> be run 
without user input, to cause the makefile builder to generate calls to the 
programs as part of the build process.</p>

<LI><p>Expected publication date is July 2002. Periodic updates will be posted via 
www.BruceEckel.com.</p>
