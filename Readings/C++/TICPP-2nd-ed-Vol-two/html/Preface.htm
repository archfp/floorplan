Preface</H1></FONT>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=4><a NAME="TIC2V2_PREFACE_I1"></a>
Like any
human language, C++ provides a way to express concepts. If successful, this
medium of expression will be significantly easier and more flexible than the
alternatives as problems grow larger and more complex. </FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">You can&#8217;t just look at C++ as a
collection of features; some of the features make no sense in isolation. You can
only use the sum of the parts if you are thinking about <I>design</I>, not
simply coding. And to understand C++ in this way, you must understand the
problems with C and with programming in general. This book discusses programming
problems, why they are problems, and the approach C++ has taken to solve such
problems. Thus, the set of features I explain in each chapter will be based on
the way that I see a particular type of problem being solved with the language.
In this way I hope to move you, a little at a time, from understanding C to the
point where the C++ mindset becomes your native
tongue.

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Throughout, I&#8217;ll be taking the
attitude that you want to build a model in your head that allows you to
understand the language all the way down to the bare metal; if you encounter a
puzzle you&#8217;ll be able to feed it to your model and deduce the answer. I
will try to convey to you the insights which have rearranged my brain to make me
start &#8220;thinking in
C++.&#8221;

What&#8217;s new in the second edition</H2></FONT>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">This book is a thorough rewrite of the
first edition to reflect all the changes introduced in C++ by the finalization
of the ANSI/ISO C++ Standard. The entire text present in the first edition has
been examined and rewritten, sometimes removing old examples, often changing
existing examples and adding new ones, and adding many new exercises.
Significant rearrangement and re-ordering of the material took place to reflect
the availability of better tools and my improved understanding of how people
learn C++. A new chapter was added which is a rapid introduction to the C
concepts and basic C++ features for those who haven&#8217;t been exposed. The CD
ROM bound into the back of the book contains a seminar which is an even gentler
introduction to the C concepts necessary to understand C++ (or Java). It was
created by Chuck Allison for my company (MindView, Inc.) and it&#8217;s called
&#8220;Thinking in C: Foundations for Java and C++.&#8221; It introduces you to
the aspects of C that are necessary for you to move on to C++ or Java (leaving
out the nasty bits that C programmers must deal with on a day-to-day basis but
that the C++ and Java languages steer you away from).</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">So the short answer is: what isn&#8217;t
brand new has been rewritten, sometimes to the point where you wouldn&#8217;t
recognize the original examples and
material.

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">In the first edition of this book, I
decided to assume that someone else had taught you C and that you have at least
a reading level of comfort with it. My primary focus was on simplifying what I
found difficult &#8211; the C++ language. In this edition I have added a chapter
that is a very rapid introduction to C, along with the <I>Thinking in C</I>
seminar-on-CD, but still assuming that you have some kind of programming
experience already. In addition, just as you learn many new words intuitively by
seeing them in context in a novel, it&#8217;s possible to learn a great deal
about C from the context in which it is used in the rest of the
book.

Learning C++</H2></FONT>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">I clawed my way into C++ from exactly the
same position as I expect many of the readers of this book will: As a programmer
with a very no-nonsense, nuts-and-bolts attitude about programming. Worse, my
background and experience was in hardware-level embedded programming, where C
has often been considered a high-level language and an inefficient overkill for
pushing bits around. I discovered later that I wasn&#8217;t even a very good C
programmer, hiding my ignorance of structures, <B>malloc(&#160;)</B> &amp;
<B>free(&#160;)</B>, <B>setjmp(&#160;)</B> &amp; <B>longjmp(&#160;)</B>, and

subjects came up in conversation rather than reaching out for new
knowledge.

</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">At about the same time that <I>Using
C++</I> came out, I began teaching the language in live seminars and
presentations. Teaching C++ (and later, Java) became my profession; I&#8217;ve
seen nodding heads, blank faces, and puzzled expressions in audiences all over
the world since 1989. As I began giving in-house training with smaller groups of
people, I discovered something during the exercises. Even those people who were
smiling and nodding were confused about many issues. I found out, by creating
and chairing the C++ and Java tracks at the Software Development Conference for
many years, that I and other speakers tended to give the typical audience too
many topics, too fast. So eventually, through both variety in the audience level
and the way that I presented the material, I would end up losing some portion of
the audience. Maybe it&#8217;s asking too much, but because I am one of those
people resistant to traditional lecturing (and for most people, I believe, such
resistance results from boredom), I wanted to try to keep everyone up to
speed.

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">For a time, I was creating a number of
different presentations in fairly short order. Thus, I ended up learning by
experiment and iteration (a technique that also works well in C++ program
design). Eventually I developed a course using everything I had learned from my
teaching experience. It tackles the learning problem in discrete, easy-to-digest
steps and for a hands-on seminar (the ideal learning situation), there are
exercises following each of the presentations.

over the course of two years, and the material in this book has been road-tested

works well as a teaching medium. But it isn&#8217;t just a seminar handout
&#8211; I tried to pack as much information as I could within these pages, and
structure it to draw you through, onto the next subject. More than anything, the
book is designed to serve the solitary reader, struggling with a new programming

simple step at a time, so the reader can easily digest each concept before
moving on.</FONT><LI><FONT FACE="Verdana">	</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia">Use
examples that are as simple and short as possible. This sometimes prevents me
from tackling &#8220;real-world&#8221; problems, but I&#8217;ve found that
beginners are usually happier when they can understand every detail of an
example rather than being impressed by the scope of the problem it solves. Also,
there&#8217;s a severe limit to the amount of code that can be absorbed in a
classroom situation. For this I sometimes receive criticism for using &#8220;toy
examples,&#8221; but I&#8217;m willing to accept that in favor of producing
something pedagogically
useful.</FONT><LI><FONT FACE="Verdana">	</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia">Carefully
sequence the presentation of features so that you aren&#8217;t seeing something
you haven&#8217;t been exposed to. Of course, this isn&#8217;t always possible;
in those situations, a brief introductory description will be
given.</FONT><LI><FONT FACE="Verdana">	</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia">Give you what
I think is important for you to understand about the language, rather than
everything I know. I believe there is an &#8220;information importance
hierarchy,&#8221; and there are some facts that 95% of programmers will never
need to know, but that would just confuse people and add to their perception of
the complexity of the language. To take an example from C, if you memorize the
operator precedence table (I never did) you can write clever code. But if
<I>you</I> have to think about it, it will confuse the reader/maintainer of that
code. So forget about precedence, and use parentheses when things aren&#8217;t
clear. This same attitude will be taken with some information in the C++
language, which I think is more important for compiler writers than for
programmers.</FONT><LI><FONT FACE="Verdana">	</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia">Keep
each section focused enough so the lecture time &#8211; and the time between
exercise periods &#8211; is small. Not only does this keep the audience&#8217;
minds more active and involved during a hands-on seminar, but it gives the
reader a greater sense of
accomplishment.</FONT><LI><FONT FACE="Verdana">	</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia">Provide
the reader with a solid foundation so they can understand the issues well enough
to move on to more difficult coursework and books (in particular, Volume 2 of
this
book).</FONT><LI><FONT FACE="Verdana">	</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia">I&#8217;ve
endeavored not to use any particular vendor&#8217;s version of C++ because, for
learning the language, I don&#8217;t feel like the details of a particular
implementation are as important as the language itself. Most vendors&#8217;
documentation concerning their own implementation specifics is
adequate.</FONT><A NAME="_Toc312373772"></A><A NAME="_Toc462305069"></A><A NAME="_Toc519041869"></A></OL><A NAME="Heading8"></A><FONT FACE = "Verdana, Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, Sans"><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">C++ is a language where new and different
features are built on top of an existing syntax. (Because of this it is referred
to as a <I>hybrid</I> object-oriented programming language.) As more people have
passed through the learning curve, we&#8217;ve begun to get a feel for the way
programmers move through the stages of the C++ language features. Because it
appears to be the natural progression of the procedurally-trained mind, I
decided to understand and follow this same path, and accelerate the process by
posing and answering the questions that came to me as I learned the language and
that came from audiences as I taught
it.

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">This course was designed with one thing
in mind: to streamline the process of learning the C++ language. Audience
feedback helped me understand which parts were difficult and needed extra
illumination. In the areas where I got ambitious and included too many features
all at once, I came to know &#8211; through the process of presenting the
material &#8211; that if you include a lot of new features, you have to explain
them all, and the student&#8217;s confusion is easily compounded. As a result,
I&#8217;ve taken a great deal of trouble to introduce the features as few at a
time as possible; ideally, only one major concept at a time per
chapter.

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">The goal, then, is for each chapter to
teach a single concept, or a small group of associated concepts, in such a way
that no additional features are relied upon. That way you can digest each piece
in the context of your current knowledge before moving on. To accomplish this, I
leave some C features in place for longer than I would prefer. The benefit is
that you will not be confused by seeing all the C++ features used before they
are explained, so your introduction to the language will be gentle and will
mirror the way you will assimilate the features if left to your own
devices.

sounds simple at first: A new class is inherited from more than one existing
class. However, you can end up with ambiguities and multiple copies of
base-class objects. That problem is solved with virtual base classes, but the
bigger issue remains: When do you use it? Multiple inheritance is only essential
when you need to manipulate an object through more than one common base class.
This chapter explains the syntax for multiple inheritance, and shows alternative
approaches &#8211; in particular, how templates solve one common problem. The
use of multiple inheritance to repair a &#8220;damaged&#8221; class interface is
demonstrated as a genuinely valuable use of this
feature.

handling has always been a problem in programming. Even if you dutifully return
error information or set a flag, the function caller may simply ignore it.
Exception handling is a primary feature in C++ that solves this problem by
allowing you to &#8220;throw&#8221; an object out of your function when a
critical error happens. You throw different types of objects for different
errors, and the function caller &#8220;catches&#8221; these objects in separate
error handling routines. If you throw an exception, it cannot be ignored, so you
can guarantee that <I>something</I> will happen in response to your
error.

that type. But occasionally it is very helpful to know the exact type of an

Language support</H3></FONT>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Your compiler may not support all the
features discussed in this book, especially if you don&#8217;t have the newest
version of your compiler. Implementing a language like C++ is a Herculean task,
and you can expect that the features will appear in pieces rather than all at
once. But if you attempt one of the examples in the book and get a lot of errors
from the compiler, it&#8217;s not necessarily a bug in the code or the compiler
&#8211; it may simply not be implemented in your particular compiler
yet.

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">The ideas and understanding in this book
have come from many sources: friends like Chuck Allison, Andrea Provaglio, Dan
Saks, Scott Meyers, Charles Petzold, and Michael Wilk; pioneers of the language
like Bjarne Stroustrup, Andrew Koenig, and Rob Murray; members of the C++
Standards Committee like Nathan Myers (who was particularly helpful and generous
with his insights), Tom Plum, Reg Charney, Tom Penello, Sam Druker, and Uwe
Steinmueller; people who have spoken in my C++ track at the Software Development
Conference; and very often students in my seminars, who ask the questions I need
to hear in order to make the material
clearer.
